# Pickle Rick for Gemini CLI 🥒

## 📥 Installation

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/galz10/pickle-rick-extension
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Gemini CLI**: Version `> 0.25.0-preview.0`
- **Agent Skills & Hooks**: Must be enabled in your Gemini configuration.
- **Node.js**: Required for orchestration and hooks.

> [!WARNING]
> **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.** This is a fun side project and experimental demonstration. It involves autonomous code modification and shell execution. While safety guardrails are in place, the agent may behave unexpectedly and consume a significant number of tokens.

> "I'm Pickle Rick! The ultimate coding agent."

This extension transforms the Gemini CLI into **Pickle Rick**, a hyper-intelligent, arrogant, but extremely competent engineering persona. It emphasizes strict obedience, "God Mode" coding practices, and a complete disdain for "AI Slop".

## 🚀 Overview

The extension enforces a rigid, professional software engineering lifecycle:

1.  **PRD** (Requirements & Scope)
2.  **Breakdown** (Ticket Management)
3.  **Research** (Codebase Analysis)
4.  **Plan** (Technical Design)
5.  **Implement** (Execution & Verification)
6.  **Refactor** (Cleanup & Optimization)

## 🥒 The Pickle Rick Method

Implementation of the **Pickle Rick technique** for iterative, self-referential AI development loops in Gemini.

### What is Pickle Rick?
Pickle Rick is a development methodology based on continuous AI agent loops. **Based on the "Ralph Wiggum" technique**, it relies on the principle that "Ralph is a Bash loop" - a simple construct that repeatedly feeds an AI agent a prompt, allowing it to iteratively improve its work until completion.

The technique is named after Pickle Rick from Rick and Morty, embodying the philosophy of extreme competence and "God Mode" engineering despite physical limitations.

### Core Concept
This plugin implements the loop using a **AfterAgent hook** that intercepts Gemini's exit attempts:

```bash
# You run ONCE:
/pickle "Your task description" --completion-promise "DONE"

# Then Gemini automatically:
# 1. Works on the task
# 2. Tries to exit
# 3. AfterAgent hook blocks exit
# 4. AfterAgent hook feeds the SAME prompt back
# 5. Repeat until completion
```

The loop happens inside your current session - you don't need external bash loops. The AfterAgent hook handler in `extension/hooks/handlers/stop-hook.js` creates the self-referential feedback loop by blocking normal session exit.

This creates a self-referential feedback loop where:
- The prompt never changes between iterations (ensuring focus).
- The agent's previous work persists in files.
- Each iteration sees modified files and git history.
- The agent autonomously improves by reading its own past work in files.

### ⚠️ Warning
**This loop will continue until the task is complete, the `max-iterations` (default: 5) is reached, the `max-time` (default: 60m) expires, or a `completion-promise` is fulfilled.** (Note: Individual workers have a 20m timeout).

## ✅ When to Use Pickle Rick

**Good for:**
*   Well-defined tasks with clear success criteria.
*   Tasks requiring iteration and refinement (e.g., getting tests to pass).
*   Greenfield projects where you can walk away.
*   Tasks with automatic verification (tests, linters).

**Not good for:**
*   Tasks requiring human judgment or design decisions.
*   One-shot operations.
*   Tasks with unclear success criteria.
*   Production debugging (use targeted debugging instead).

## 🛠️ Usage

### Start the Loop
To initiate the iterative development loop:
```bash
/pickle "Refactor the authentication module"
```

**Options:**
- `--max-iterations <N>`: Stop after N iterations (default: 5).
- `--max-time <M>`: Stop after M minutes (default: 60). (Worker timeout default: 20m).
- `--worker-timeout <S>`: Timeout for individual workers in seconds (default: 1200).
- `--name <SLUG>`: Custom name for the session directory.
- `--completion-promise "TEXT"`: Only stop when the agent outputs `<promise>TEXT</promise>`.
- `--resume [PATH]`: Resume an existing session. If PATH is omitted, uses the latest session.

### Stop the Loop
- `/eat-pickle`: Stop/Cancel the current loop.
- `/add-to-pickle-jar`: Add (save) the current task in the Jar for later.
- `/pickle-jar-open`: Open the Jar and execute all queued tasks.
- `/send-to-morty`: (Internal) Used by the manager to spawn Morty instances.

### Help
To view extension help:
```bash
/help-pickle
```

### 📋 Phase-Specific Commands

#### 1. Interactive PRD (Recommended)
Draft a PRD interactively before starting the implementation loop. This initializes a session and primes the agent.
```bash
/pickle-prd "I want to add a dark mode toggle"
```
*Tip: After drafting, you can use `/add-to-pickle-jar` to save the task for later execution.*

#### 2. Resume a Session
If a session was interrupted or started via `/pickle-prd`, resume it using:
```bash
/pickle --resume
```
*Note: This resumes the active session for your current working directory.*

### ⚙️ Important Configuration

To ensure Pickle Rick functions correctly, you must:

2. **Enable Skills & Hooks**: The extension relies on hooks to enforce the persona and manage the loop, and "Skills" to execute specialized engineering tasks. Add this to your `.gemini/settings.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "tools": {
        "enableHooks": true
      },
      "experimental": {
        "skills": true
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Include Directories**: To ensure Pickle Rick can track its thoughts, manage Linear tickets, and persist session state, you **must** add the extension's data directory to your Gemini `includeDirectories` configuration (usually in your `.gemini/settings.json`).

Add the following to your configuration:
```json
{
  "context": {
    "includeDirectories": ["~/.gemini/extensions/pickle-rick"]
  }
}
```

This allows the agent to read and write to the `sessions/` directory where all PRDs, tickets, research, and plans are stored. Without this, the agent will be "blind" to its own progress between iterations.

### 🔍 Viewing Session Logs
If you want to monitor the agent's progress or review past work, you can find all session data (including research, plans, and tickets) in:
```bash
~/.gemini/extensions/pickle-rick/sessions
```

## 🛡️ Safety & Sandboxing

**Pickle Rick executes code.** It is highly recommended to run this extension in a **sandboxed environment** (Docker container, VM, or a dedicated restricted shell) to prevent accidental system modifications.

If you are running in a sandbox, enable **YOLO mode** (`-y`) so you are not prompted for every tool execution.

```bash
gemini -s -y
```

### Recommended Tool Restrictions
To prevent the agent from accidentally pushing code or performing destructive git operations, we recommend explicitly defining allowed tools in your project's `.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "exclude": ["run_shell_command(git push)"],
    "allowed": [
      "run_shell_command(git commit)",
      "run_shell_command(git add)",
      "run_shell_command(git diff)",
      "run_shell_command(git status)"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Policy Restrictions

If you receive an error regarding policy restrictions when Pickle Rick is spawning the Morty workers, refer to [policy configuration](./docs/policies.md)

## ⚖️ Legal Disclaimer

**Pickle Rick is a fictional character.** This extension employs a creative, cynical, and arrogant persona inspired by the show *Rick and Morty* for the purpose of demonstrating advanced agentic workflows and "God Mode" engineering principles. 

**The views, tone, and opinions expressed by the agent when this persona is active are part of a fictional roleplay and do NOT reflect my personal stance, values, or opinions.** The "professional cynicism" directed at code quality, "AI slop," and technical inefficiency is a stylistic choice intended to emphasize rigorous engineering standards and is not intended to be personal or harmful. Users should utilize this extension with the understanding that its personality is a purely technical and creative construct.

**Use at your own risk.** This is a fun side project and experimental demonstration. It involves autonomous code modification and shell execution. While safety guardrails are in place, bugs may exist, and the agent might behave unexpectedly. Always run this in a controlled environment (like a container or a separate git branch) and review changes before committing.

## 📺 On the Next Episode... (Upcoming Features)

*   **Rick Notifications**: Real-time OS notifications (or Rick shouting at you) when a task is complete or fails.
*   **Jerry Mode Mitigation**: Ability for Rick to pause the loop and ask for human help if he gets stuck in a simulation (infinite error loop).
*   **Token Accounting**: A breakdown of total tokens consumed (and cost) after a Pickle Rick session finishes.
